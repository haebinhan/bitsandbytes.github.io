Start off by making sure you have everything set up that's required: you will need to install Node.js and have a code editor such as Visual Studio Code. Node.js can be installed from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

Aftewards, discord.js must be installed from Node's package manager, npm. It comes with Node.js, so simply set up a new project folder for your discord bot, cd into there, and start by running `nmp init`. This command will create a package.json file which keeps track of project dependences. To isntall discord.js, run the `npm install discord.js` command in the terminal. 

While not necessary, a linter can be installed to help your code stay neat and avoid errors. Check [this page](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-linter.html#installing-a-code-editor) for an easy tutorial on downloading a linter.
